        <h3>Hospital Management System</h3>
        <p>A hospital management system is a cloud-based system that facilitates managing the effective functioning of the hospital. When you create HMS software,  confirm you turn all paperwork functionalities into online services such as prescriptions, insurance details, treatment charges, and more. 
           
           You should build respective databases, forms, and pages to manage all the information regarding patients, doctors, staff, Pharmacy, Lab, Billing, etc. You can follow HTML, CSS, JScript, ASP.Net, C#, and SQL Server to construct HMS for your project.</p>

        <h3>Chatbot</h3>
        <p>You can build a super-simple chatbot for your college’s mini project. It can design for mobile and web. The project aims to understand the user intent in the queries and to give them more human answers.  

            The basic functionality would be this: when a user enters a question in the system, the bot will analyze the keywords and generate an appropriate response specific to the user’s intent. 
            
            Ensure you feed data on different topics such as art, science, psychology, food, entertainment, education, culture, travel, health, politics, and more. Since chatbots are a show-stunner in today’s world, this project would be an excellent choice for you.     </p>
